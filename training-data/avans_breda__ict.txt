ABOUT THE PROGRAM
Become the ICT professional of the future with the HBO (higher professional education) ICT program, formerly known as Informatics. Learn to build software, provide advice, and work with new technologies in the field of AI and Cyber Security.

In the HBO ICT program, you conceive and create digital solutions for real problems. Think of an app for your energy consumption or a system that helps companies work smarter. You learn how to leverage data and make software secure and sustainable. During the ICT program, you work on practice-oriented projects, often in teams. You practice roles such as programmer, analyst, consultant, or project leader. This way, you discover your strengths and what energizes you. You choose your own specialization.

SPECIALIZATIONS

Breda:
In Breda, you focus on Complex Software Systems, Embedded Software, Artificial Intelligence, or Cyber Security. You actively work with all phases of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): from idea and design to implementation and commissioning.

Den Bosch:
In Den Bosch, you choose Software Engineering or Business IT & Management. In Business IT & Management, you investigate how processes can be made smarter. With your IT knowledge, you devise solutions and collaborate with developers to implement them. Sometimes you have software built, sometimes you create it yourself. You learn to advise and guide organizations through digital transformations.

After completing your ICT program, you will hold a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree and be ready for the future.

WHY THE ICT PROGRAM?
- You will become an ICT professional who adapts to new developments.
- You start broad and discover what suits you. Then you choose a specialization.
- You work on projects that contribute to societal issues.
- You study in small groups under the guidance of lecturers.

WHAT ARE YOU TRAINED FOR?
The ICT program trains you to become an (embedded) software engineer, but that is certainly not the only direction. In Den Bosch, for example, you can choose Business IT & Management, where you advise organizations and make processes smarter with IT. In Breda, you can opt for Complex Software Systems, where you develop secure and reliable software and work on projects with AI components.

POSSIBLE PROFESSIONS AFTER THIS PROGRAM:
- Software Developer: You build apps, websites, or other software with a team.
- Software Solution Architect: You think at a higher level: what systems are needed for the entire company and how do they connect?
- Artificial Intelligence Engineer: You work with smart technology and build systems that can learn and make decisions independently.
- Cyber Security Engineer: You ensure that software and systems are secure and protected against attacks.
- Lead Developer: You program and lead a team of other developers.
- ICT Consultant: You advise companies on how best to utilize ICT.
- IT Project Manager: You manage teams working on large software projects.
- Data Analyst: You extract insights from large amounts of data and help organizations progress with them.
- Embedded Software Developer: You develop embedded software with a team that runs on specific hardware components.

WHAT IS EXPECTED OF YOU?
You choose the HBO ICT program because you are curious about technology and want to know how software works. You want to learn how to help businesses and organizations work smarter with ICT. In doing so, you use your analytical and creative thinking skills to identify and solve problems. You like to maintain an overview and plan your work well. You can work both independently and collaboratively, whether with clients or colleagues in an ICT team. Prior programming knowledge is not required.

FURTHER EDUCATION
If you wish to continue studying after your ICT program, you can specialize or broaden your skills with a 1 or 2-year Master's program. This can be done at a university of applied sciences (hogeschool) or a research university (universiteit). Avans also offers various Master's programs that align with HBO-ICT, such as Chain Information Systems, Strategic Information, Management and ERP, and Logistics. Prefer to go to a research university? Choose the HBO Top Program transfer minor, which allows you to start a university Master's degree faster.

CURRICULUM (DEN BOSCH)
In Den Bosch, you enroll in ICT and choose a specialization that suits you: Software Engineering (SE) or Business IT & Management (BIM). You learn more than just programming. Every 10 weeks, you work on a team project within a specific theme. Lessons and courses help you execute that project effectively. You also work on practical assignments, conduct research, and contribute to societal projects. You learn how to collaborate, communicate, plan a project, and work in a customer-oriented manner.
